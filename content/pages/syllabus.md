Course Structure
----------------

The course will consist of lectures, homework assignments and a project on a topic related to the student's area of interest. We will aim for the right balance of theory and "applications". The course has no specific prerequisites, although a basic knowledge of Fourier transforms is recommended. We start with time-invariant filters and basic wavelets. The text gives an overall perspective of the field -- which has grown with amazing speed. The topics will include

*   Analysis of Filter Banks and Wavelets
*   Design Methods
*   Applications
*   Hands-on Experience with Software

These four key areas will be developed in detail.

### Analysis

*   Multirate Signal Processing: Filtering, Decimation, Polyphase, Perfect Reconstruction and Aliasing Removal.
*   Matrix Analysis: Toeplitz Matrices and Fast Algorithms.
*   Wavelet Transform: Pyramid and Cascade Algorithms, Daubechies Wavelets, Orthogonal and Biorthogonal Wavelets, Smoothness, Approximation, Boundary Filters and Wavelets, Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis, Second-Generation Wavelets.  
    

### Design Methods

*   Spectral Factorization, Cosine-Modulated Filter Banks, Lattice Structure, Ladder Structure (Lifting.)  
    

### Applications

*   Audio and Image Compression, Quantization Effects, Digital Communication and Multicarrier Modulation, Transmultiplexers, Text-Image Compression: Lossy and Lossless, Medical Imaging and Scientific Visualization, Edge Detection and Feature Extraction, Seismic Signal Analysis, Geometric Modeling, Matrix Preconditioning, Multiscale Methods for Partial Differential Equations and Integral Equations.  
    

### Simulation Software

*   MATLAB{{< sup "Â®" >}} Wavelet Toolbox, Software for Filter Design, Signal Analysis, Image Compression, PDEs, Wavelet Transforms on Complex Geometrical Shapes.  
    

We encourage you to learn about wavelets and their applications.
